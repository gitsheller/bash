Redirections

Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment.
 redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command 
 or may follow a command.Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right. 
 
 n
 {varname}
 
 >&-
 <&-
 
 ls > dirlist 2>&1
 ls 2>&1 > dirlist
 
 /dev/fd/fd
 /dev/stdin
 /dev/stdout
 /dev/stderr
 /dev/tcp/host/port
 /dev/udp/host/port
 Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used with care,
 as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses internally.
 
 [n]<word
 [n]>[|]word
noclobber
[n]>>word
&>word  >&word(csh)  >word 2>&1
&>>word  >>word 2>&1            >>&(csh)

<<[-]word
        here-document
delimiter       # no blanks at the beginnig
No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or filename expansion is performed on word.
 If any characters in word are quoted,the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, 
 and the lines in the here-document are not expanded.
 If word is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are
 subjected to parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. 
 In the latter case, the character sequence \newline is ignored,
 and ‘\’ ust be used to quote the characters ‘\’, ‘$’, and ‘`’. 
 If the redirection operator is ‘<<-’,
then all leading tab characters are stripped from input lines and the line containing delimiter.
This allows here-documents within shell scripts to be indented in a natural fashion. 

 Here Strings
 A variant of here documents
 <<< word
 The word is expanded and supplied to the command on its standard input. 
 
 Duplicating File Descriptors
 [n]<&word      If word evaluates to ‘-’, file descriptor n is closed.
 [n]>&word
 
 Moving File Descriptors
 [n]<&digit-      digit is closed after being duplicated to n. 
 [n]>&digit-
 
  Opening File Descriptors for Reading and Writing
  [n]<>word      n defaults to 0
