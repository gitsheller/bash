Special Builtins

When Bash is executing in POSIX mode,
the special builtins differ from other builtin commands in three respects:

1. Special builtins are found before shell functions during command lookup. 
2.  If a special builtin returns an error status, a non-interactive shell exits. 
3.  Assignment statements preceding the command stay in effect in the shell environment after the command completes.
